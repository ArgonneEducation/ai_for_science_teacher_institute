  <p align="center">
    This repo is intended to be a central hub for sharing materials for and from the ai for science teacher institute.  
We also hope to use it to provide tips for how to get started with python coding for new coders.

This GitHub repository is set up for users to be able to access the coding materials during and after the ai for science teacher institute program.  GitHub is a platform that allows developers to store their code, and we are taking advantage of that functionality.  It also allows developers to collaborate on code – this is a functionality that we are not taking advantage of here, since we expect many of the users we send to this site to be relatively new at developing code and using it for teaching science.

This ReadMe is organized in a way that you will hopefully find to be easy to follow, whether you are new to coding or more advanced.  For beginners, you may want to start with the “Getting Started” section.  In it, we’ll guide you to using GitHub codespaces for your coding.  While there are many other platforms that you could use for this purpose, codespaces will allow you to access the files you need right alongside your coding environment, with a minimal amount of setup work to be done before diving in.  
</p>
<p align="left">
The “Getting Started” section therefore starts with setting up your own GitHub account.  This is required for using codespaces, and honestly, anyone who wants more flexibility in their coding environment probably will have a GitHub account.  So it seems like a very reasonable place to start.

## Getting Started

## Setting up your GitHub Account
You’ll need an account in order to use the codespaces functionality within GitHub.  You can access the files without an account, but will then need to interact with the code outside of GitHub.  We’ll provide more information about how you might do this later in this ReadMe document.

Navigate to https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github . This GitHub resource provides information about the process.  
Setup your GitHub account as described in the above link.

## Starting up a codespace from the template
The ai_for_science_teacher_institute repository is a template.  It is reasonably simple to start up a codespace to run the files in the repository.  Here's how.

*1 Navigate to https://github.com/ArgonneEducation/ai_for_science_teacher_institute*

*2 Opening the template in a codespace*

Near the top right hand corner of the screen, find the button that says “Use this template” and click on it.

<br>
Click on the “Open in a codespace” selection.

<br>

## Stopping a Codespace
It is a good idea to make it a practice to stop your codespace from running while you are not using it.  It will use resources in the background and in the cloud if you do not.  For this reason, we'll show you how to stop the codespace before doing anything else with it.  You will be able to open up your codespace at a later time.  We'll show you that too!

Your codespace has a name generated by GitHub that you can see in the address bar of your internet browser.  My codespace for developing this readme is called urban-guacamole.  I know this because it is in the address bar as shown. Check to see what your codespace is named!
<br>

<br>
<br>
Simply closing out of the browser tab does not stop all activity in the codespace.  To do so, return to your GitHub home page and click on the hamburger menu (3 stacked horizontal lines) at the top left hand corner next to the cat icon. 
<br>
<br>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArgonneEducation/ai_for_science_teacher_institute/refs/heads/main/imgs/codespace1.png" alt="screen-grab" style ="width:300px;"/> 
<br>
<br>
Then select “Codespaces” from the list that appears.
<br>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArgonneEducation/ai_for_science_teacher_institute/refs/heads/main/imgs/codespace2.png" alt="screen-grab" style ="width:250px;"/> 
<br>
At the bottom of the page, you should see the name of your codespace.  
<br>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArgonneEducation/ai_for_science_teacher_institute/refs/heads/main/imgs/codespace_name.png" alt="screen-grab" style ="width:700px;"/> 
<br>
You can shut it down by clicking on the 3 dots at the far right, and selecting “Stop codespace” . 
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArgonneEducation/ai_for_science_teacher_institute/refs/heads/main/imgs/codespaces_menu.png" alt="screen-grab" style ="width:200px;"/> 
</div>
<br>

 Your codespace should then no longer be Active.  You can restart your work from this page at any time.  You might also choose to open the notebooks from JupyterLab using this same menu.  

## Opening a Codespace in JupyterLab
Our suggestion is to open the repository in JupyterLab via GitHub Codespaces.  The content was developed using JupyterLab so some of it will not be as clear with a different platform.
Start by logging in to your GitHub account.

To access your codespaces, click on the hamburger menu (3 stacked horizontal lines) at the top left hand corner next to the cat icon. 
<br>
<br>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArgonneEducation/ai_for_science_teacher_institute/refs/heads/main/imgs/codespace1.png" alt="screen-grab" style ="width:300px;"/> 
<br>
<br>
Then select “Codespaces” from the list that appears.
<br>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArgonneEducation/ai_for_science_teacher_institute/refs/heads/main/imgs/codespace2.png" alt="screen-grab" style ="width:250px;"/> 
<br>
At the bottom of the page, you should see the name of your codespace.  
<br>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArgonneEducation/ai_for_science_teacher_institute/refs/heads/main/imgs/codespace_name.png" alt="screen-grab" style ="width:700px;"/> 
<br>
You can open the codespace by clicking on the 3 dots at the far right, and selecting “Open in JupyterLab” . 
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArgonneEducation/ai_for_science_teacher_institute/refs/heads/main/imgs/codespaces_menu.png" alt="screen-grab" style ="width:200px;"/> 
</div>
<br>
Once you’ve opened the repository, you can explore the notebooks with the file explorer in the left pane of the screen.  The repository contains a folder titled “notebooks”.  This folder contains Jupyter notebooks, which are indicated with a “.ipynb” ending.  Jupyter notebooks are a mix of python code chunks and explanatory material.  There is more information about this structure in the “01-jupyter_python_physics.ipynb” notebook.

This is a good place to start exploring the repository!  
<br>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArgonneEducation/ai_for_science_teacher_institute/refs/heads/main/imgs/Jupyter_file_explorer.png" alt="screen-grab" style ="width:700px;"/> 
<br>
The notebooks are in numerical order, with titles that also indicate something about the topics contained within the notebooks.
There is an additional folder titled “completed notebooks” that contains Jupyter notebooks that serve as answer keys for many of the notebooks.  Our suggestion is that you use these only after first trying to work through any questions.  You may want to try using google or potentially even an AI large language model before cross-checking with these completed notebooks.  Most coding problems can be solved this way, though it takes some practice, knowledge, and skill to navigate this efficiently.  Therefore, it’s good to practice doing so, rather than simply relying on the provided answers.  



## Using Without a GitHub Account
If for some reason, you would rather access the files without having to make an account, it is possible to do so.  You will first have to download the files you would like to use from the GitHub repository (step-by-step instructions below).  Then you can access these files, stored on your machine, via the online JupyterLite tool (instructions for this are also below).  

*1a Downloading Individual GitHub Files*

To download files from the GitHub repository, navigate to https://github.com/ArgonneEducation/ai_for_science_teacher_institute, and open the notebooks folder. When you open up a file, it is displayed on the screen and some options appear in the upper right hand corner.
<br>
<br>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArgonneEducation/ai_for_science_teacher_institute/refs/heads/main/imgs/download_from_repository.png" alt="screen-grab" style ="width:700px;"/> 
<br>
<br>
Simply clicking on the download button with the downward pointing arrow will download the file into your downloads folder.  From there, you could save it to a folder, perhaps titled ai_for_science_teacher_institute.  
<br>
<br>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArgonneEducation/ai_for_science_teacher_institute/refs/heads/main/imgs/download_closeup.png" alt="screen-grab" style ="width:300px;"/> 
<br>
<br>
If you download the files this way, you will have to create the folder organization system on your machine.

*1b Downloading a Folder from GitHub*

It is possible to download an entire folder from a GitHub repository.  For example, to download the entire contents of the “notebooks” folder, you’ll need its URL.  https://github.com/ArgonneEducation/ai_for_science_teacher_institute/tree/main/notebooks
GitHub has a tool for downloading a zipped folder at https://download-directory.github.io
Simply paste in the URL for the notebook directory and press Enter to download a zipped folder with all of the notebooks.  Extract the files to a folder location of your choosing on your machine.

*2 Opening Files with JupyterLite*

To open your notebook file with JupyterLite, first navigate to https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/notebooks/?path=notebooks/Intro.ipynb in your browser.  This gives an introductory notebook.
From here, click on File in the menu bar and select Open…
<br>
<br>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArgonneEducation/ai_for_science_teacher_institute/refs/heads/main/imgs/open_jupyter_lite.png" alt="screen-grab" style ="width:700px;"/> 
<br>
<br>
In the new tab that appears, you’ll next want to upload the notebook that you’d like to run. The "upload" button is in the top right corner of the screen.
<br>
<br>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArgonneEducation/ai_for_science_teacher_institute/refs/heads/main/imgs/jupyter_upload.png" alt="screen-grab" style ="width:300px;"/> 
<br>
<br>
If you click upload while in the main folder, your file will appear in the file list.  You may want to first open the notebooks folder and then upload the notebook you would like to use.
<br>
<br>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArgonneEducation/ai_for_science_teacher_institute/refs/heads/main/imgs/jupyter_file_uploaded.png" alt="screen-grab" style ="width:700px;"/> 
<br>
<br>
If you open the file by double clicking on it, you will be prompted to Select a Kernel.
<br>
<br>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArgonneEducation/ai_for_science_teacher_institute/refs/heads/main/imgs/jupyter_select_kernel.png" alt="screen-grab" style ="width:700px;"/> 
<br>
<br>
Click on Select to start the kernel.  This just means that it is activating the ability for JupyterLite to run python code. 
You are now ready to explore the notebook!
