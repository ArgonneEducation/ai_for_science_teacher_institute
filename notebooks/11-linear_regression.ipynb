    "Here's why `seaborn` is particularly useful, especially for exploring relationships in data and creating clear scientific visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Less Code**: Seaborn provides a higher-level interface than Matplotlib. This means you can often create complex and statistically-rich plots with fewer lines of code. \n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Integrated with Pandas DataFrames**: Seaborn is designed to work seamlessly with pandas DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Complementary to Matplotlib**: Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib. This means your knowledge of Matplotlib is still very valuable! You can use Seaborn for the high-level plotting and then use Matplotlib functions (`plt.title()`, `plt.xlabel()`, `plt.legend()`, `plt.show()`, etc.) to further customize and refine your plots. They work together hand-in-hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Aesthetics and Professional Appearance**: Seaborn comes with built-in themes and color palettes that produce aesthetically pleasing and professional-looking plots by default."

    "\n",

    "    * Even if you only have **one independent variable** (as in simple linear regression, like 'Number of People in Room' in our example), scikit-learn expects `X` to be 2-dimensional. This is because the model is designed to handle multiple features (columns) for more complex scenarios (multiple linear regression). When you have a single feature, you often see it created as `df[['your_column_name']]` to ensure it remains a DataFrame (2D).\n",
