    "A Decision Tree is a powerful and popular tool in machine learning that works like a flowchart. It makes decisions by asking a series of simple \"if-then\" questions about the data. Think of it like a game of 20 questions—each question narrows down the possibilities until a final conclusion is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are an excellent introduction to machine learning for several key reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They are intuitive and easy to understand. The visual, flowchart-like structure makes it easy to see exactly how the model is making its decisions. You don't need complex math to follow the logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- They mirror human thinking. The process of splitting data based on a series of questions is very similar to how people often make decisions in their daily lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "- They provide a great foundation. Understanding how a single decision tree works is the first step to learning more advanced and powerful models, like Random Forests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are a type of supervised learning. This means we train the model on a dataset that already has the correct answers, or labels. The tree's job is to learn the relationship between the input data (the \"features\") and the known output labels, so it can make accurate predictions on new, unlabeled data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Spotify analyzes songs and gives them a set of attributes. In machine learning, we call these **features**. These features describe the characteristics of each song. Here are a few we'll be working with:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`danceability`**: How suitable a track is for dancing (0.0 is least danceable, 1.0 is most danceable).\n",
    "* **`energy`**: A measure of intensity and activity (0.0 is low energy, 1.0 is high energy).\n",
    "* **`acousticness`**: A measure of whether the track is acoustic (0.0 is not acoustic, 1.0 is acoustic).\n",
    "* **`valence`**: A measure of musical positiveness (0.0 is negative/sad, 1.0 is positive/happy).\n",
    "* **`liveness`**: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live.\n",
    "* **`instrumentalness`**: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. Values closer to 1.0 mean it's more likely to be an instrumental track.\n",
    "* **`speechiness`**: Detects the presence of spoken words. A higher value indicates the presence of more spoken words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to use these features to predict whether a song is **country** or **rap**."
